Castle Escape is a text-based adventure-puzzle game. The game begins in the old sewers of a castle and takes you on a journey through the castle's many twists and turns as you search for a way out while learning more and more about your surroundings. You can collect useful items along the way which may help you to escape and uncover more of the castle.
